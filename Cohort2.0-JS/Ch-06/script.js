// basic operators : 

// 1) arithmetic 

// important thing to discuss : difference between count++ and ++count

// count++ -> basically it increments the value but uses its new value in the next time but for ++count the value is incremented here itself and used 
// function hoisting is possible but with let .

// basically ye sab halua cheez hein and i can do them easily as i have done them prior hence focus on covering backlog and creating stuff


hello();
function hello(){
    console.log("hi ");
}
// chalega


// var hello ; 
hello();
var hello  = function test(){   // hello = function(){};
    console.log("xyxxx");
}
// dikkat dega because of variable hosting
